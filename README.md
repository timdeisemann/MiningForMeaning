text mining analysis of asymmetry in US parties' sentiments

The advent of the election campaign for the US presidential elections in 2020 motivates a comparative analysis of the two major parties involved. In this framework the claim of "Ideological Republicans and Group Interest Democrats: The Asymmetry of American Party Politics" by Grossmann and Hopkins (2015) will be quantitatively tested with the application of sentiment analysis using Twitter data. Current tweets of the elite of the Republican and Democratic parties (small n) reflect this asymmetry to a certain extent. The analysis of the US senate (large n) shows a different result. However, a particular degree of asymmetry remains visible for negative emotions.

This analysis serves in particular as an example to show the possibilities as well as the limits of text mining in social science research. Regardless of the relevance of the results to the political science research question, this goal is achieved. It emerges that there may often be large differences between the results of a manually manageable text analysis and an algorithmic method of text processing. Clearly, some assumed patterns must be discarded and others can only be identified when studying large data sets such as the convergence of the emotion level in several categories or the possibility of an opposition effect.
